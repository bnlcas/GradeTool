# GradeTool
This repo contains code for a SwiftUI App to quickly measure road grades.
Originally this started because San Francisco Requires you to [curb your tires on a 3% grade](https://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/drive-park/how-avoid-parking-tickets#Curb).
This basically applies to any street, so kind of useless, but I found that it was fun to know exactly how steep the hills of San Francisco can be.
Will continue to add sensors as I have free weekends, but code is not especially clean and is given as is.
